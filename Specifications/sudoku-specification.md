#### 6.1.2 Design Patterns
- Module pattern for code organization
- MVC architecture:
  - **Model**: Game state, puzzle generation, solving algorithms
  - **View**: Board rendering, UI components
  - **Controller**: Game logic, input handling, event management
- Observer pattern for state changes
- Command pattern for undo/redo functionality

### 6.2 State Management
- Centralized game state object
- Immutable state updates for undo/redo capability
- LocalStorage for persistence
