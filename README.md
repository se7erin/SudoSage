# SudoSage - Advanced Sudoku Application

SudoSage is an interactive, educational Sudoku web application designed to provide an engaging gameplay experience while teaching solving strategies through a progressive hint system.

## Project Overview

This project implements a technically sophisticated Sudoku application with:

- Efficient board representation with O(1) constraint validation
- Advanced solving algorithms and strategy detection
- Progressive hint system for learning Sudoku techniques
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Game state persistence and statistics tracking

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a progressive development approach:

1. **Core Domain Implementation** (Current Phase)
   - Hybrid data structure for board representation
   - Bit vectors for efficient constraint validation
   - Immutable state management for undo/redo

2. **Solver and Generator** (Future)
   - Backtracking algorithm with constraint propagation
   - Difficulty calibration based on solving techniques
   - Strategy detection engine

3. **UI and Interaction** (Future)
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Keyboard and touch input handling
   - Animation system for visual feedback

## Core Data Structures

The board representation uses a hybrid approach:

- 9×9 matrix for direct cell access
- Bit vectors for rows, columns, and boxes for O(1) constraint validation
- Sparse matrix for candidate tracking

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `src/index.html` in a browser to test the current implementation
3. Use the test interface to verify the board representation works correctly

## Development Progress

- Phase 1, Step 1: Board Representation ✅
  - Implemented hybrid data structure with bitwise operations
  - Created dual representation (2D array and bit vectors)
  - Added sparse matrix for candidate tracking
  - Created unit tests to verify implementation

## Next Steps

- Phase 1, Step 2: State Management Foundation
- Phase 1, Step 3: Algorithm Implementation (Constraint Propagation)
- Phase 2: Solver Engine and Generation Algorithms
